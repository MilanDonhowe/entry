1. finish introduction sequence
2. add game win sequence
3. refine level design
4. add checkpoints?
5. add coil monetization for skins :D

Theoretical Pricing:
$0.25	-	starship skin (galaga parody)
$0.25	-	puck-pal skin (pacman parody)
$0.25	-	build-boy (minecraft steve parody)
$0.25	-	sasuge-man (super meatboy parody)
$0.25	-	baby sad (isaac parody)

Is it legal to use their likeness?... might err on the side of caution and change that up.


FEEDBACK:
- improve player responsiveness ("player unresponsive", "it doesnt move very smoothly")
