<!--
    back breakers is a simple game made for the js13kGames compeition
    where game entries may be no longer than 13 kilobytes.
    Or in more basic terms:
    8 * 13,000 = 104,000 bits :)
    And that's the BITter truth!

    Gameplay inspired by one of those minigames on the hypixel mincraft server
