<!--
    back stabbers is a simple game made for the js13kGames compeition
    where game entries may be no larger than 13 kilobytes (when zipped).
    Or in more basic terms:
    8 * 13,000 = 104,000 bits :)
    And that's the BITter truth!

    The theme of the jam was "back"
    This is represented principally by the concept of "going back" through levels and avoiding your old player.
    However it is also integrated through the retro-ish pixel graphics of old games.
    The title is also a play on going back through levels and stabbing targets.  Ergo "back-stabbers"
